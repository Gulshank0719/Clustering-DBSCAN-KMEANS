# Clustering-DBSCAN-KMEANS
mall customers segmentation using clustering
This project shows how to perform a mall customers segmentation using Machine Learning algorithms. This is the unsupervised clustering problem and two popular algorithms will be presented and compared: KMeans and DBSCAN. There will be some further discussions about these algorithms alterations and their current state of developments/research. The main aim of this notebook is to cover the basics of clustering methods and touch some more advanced aspects as well.
This notebook focuses on two partitional algorithms: K-Means and DBSCAN. All are implemented in a well-known Python library: Scikit-Learn.
